# .cursorrules

This file provides AI coding assistant rules for this project.

## Primary Reference

**Read [@AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) first** - It contains comprehensive guidelines for:
- Project goals and architecture
- Code standards (BEM, TypeScript, etc.)
- Common pitfalls and anti-patterns
- Pre-commit checklist
- Key patterns in this codebase

## Quick Rules

1. **Always** run the pre-commit checklist from AGENTS.md before committing
2. **Never** duplicate code - extract to utilities if used 2+ times
3. **Remove** all debug code (console.logs, debug colors, etc.)
4. **Follow** BEM naming strictly for CSS
5. **Check** bundle size after changes (keep under 10 kB total)
6. **Test** with: `npm run type-check && npm run lint && npm run build`

## Before You Code

1. Read AGENTS.md completely
2. Check existing patterns in similar files
3. Verify you understand the architecture

Run through the "Pre-Commit Checklist for Agents" section in AGENTS.md.
